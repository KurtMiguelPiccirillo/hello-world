# hello-world
Salam everybody!

I'm a system administrator. I've heard that everyone who works in IT should have GitHub account. I disagree with this opinion. I've created my account because of my will only. I just want to make the world perfect, automate every routine task and free your time for something interesting like <s>alcohol, ladies, drugs</s> sport, family, science. I'd been generating Italian or Arabic or English like name, but you seeing that randomizer didn't add Arabian like name. When I see that name I think about suicide, loco and PIZZA. My English not perfect, so if you are reading that and your face is becoming fat, throw these sweet french croissants out! If you wanna make my English better, and if you a beautiful lady, call me.. call me "my hero".
